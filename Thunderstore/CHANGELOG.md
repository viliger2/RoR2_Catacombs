<summary>0.9.3 </summary>

* Added github link (forgot about it in 0.9.2).
* Made all entrances larger to support bigger enemies\survivors.
	* _This was specifically made to support Regigigas. You still can't fall through small holes in one of the tombs, but you can now actually get in and out of tombs. This makes some of the textures look warped but ehhh..._

<summary>0.9.2 </summary>

* Optimization pass. Added proper occlusion and setup'd LODs for majority of objects.
* Added music.
* Fixed geometry holes in the room with coffins and lemurian statues.
* Added additional box colliders to coffins, so you no longer get behind them and hide from enemies.
