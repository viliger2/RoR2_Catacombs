<summary>1.0.0 </summary>

* _**I consider 1.0.0 to be final version, I've done everything I wanted with this stage. Everything after will be either bug fixes or support for new CUMs**_.
* Added an easter egg.
	* _You'll have to mine for it._
* Added Direseeker to Champion post loop spawn pool.

<summary>0.9.4 </summary>

* Fixed music conflict with Bobomb Battlefield.
* Removed SoundAPI dependency, as it is no longer needed.
* Small optimizations to some assets that should result in slightly better performance.
* Made some tombs optional, as in they will sometimes be closed.
	* _You might say that this makes already small stage even smaller and you will be right. Fixing music issue was top priority and it came in the middle of adding another feature. So this is somewhat of a half measure that is currently left in as is._

<details>
<summary>0.9.3 </summary>

* Added github link (forgot about it in 0.9.2).
* Made all entrances larger to support bigger enemies\survivors.
	* _This was specifically made to support Regigigas. You still can't fall through small holes in one of the tombs, but you can now actually get in and out of tombs. This makes some of the textures look warped but ehhh..._

* Fixed geometry holes in the room with coffins and lemurian statues.
