# Catacombs
Catacombs is a new Stage 2, in which survivors will have to explore lemurian burial ground. With no sunlight reaching the depth of Catacombs, only torches and mysterious glowing flowers provide the light.

A big thanks to Jace for writing stage guide on Risk of Thunder wiki and creating LocationsOfPrecipitation, without him I would've not bothered with stage creation.

Please send bug reports either by tagging me on Discord in RoR2 Modding server or message me directly @viliger. Github page with VS, Unity and Wwise project is now available.

## Features

  * Smaller, more claustrophobic stage, while offering the same interactable count. This is offset by low light and visibility.
  * Unique combination of enemies (vultures, lemurians, wisps and golems).
  * Supports both DLC and Vanilla enemy and interactable pools.

## TODO\Future things
<details>

  * <s>Since apparently at the time of release Wwise for RoR2's Unity version is discontinued, currently stage offers no new tracks for stage itself and boss fight. I want to change this.</s> Done.
  * Modded enemy support. At the very least Direseeker, he is thematically appropriate.
